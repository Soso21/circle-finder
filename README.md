# Circle-Finder

Circle Finder is a script that can find circles or round-shaped objects in an image. This is extremely useful for projects involving eye tracking, finding planets, astronomy, and more. Additionally, this script will not only find circles from the original image, but also apply various image processing techniques to ensure the best conditions are set to find the circles. The circles are found using the Hough Circle Transform.

## Installation

Just download the script and run it directly! It will guide you through the steps.
